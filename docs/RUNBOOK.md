# RUNBOOK — Tier-1 live smoke (operator steps)

Everything here is a **human/operator** procedure. The build agent (`dev`) cannot and
must not perform these steps: it can't read the credential, and it deliberately can't
write the binary that `appsvc` executes (a builder-writable binary would nullify the
secret boundary).

## What the builder staged

- Binary: `/home/dev/dist/temur`
  (i686 musl-static ELF, release, stripped — the `i686-unknown-linux-musl`
  build gated by `scripts/check.sh`)
- sha256: recorded by the builder at each staging; verify before install with
  `sha256sum /home/dev/dist/temur` against the value reported for that build.

## 1. Install (root: `wsl -d Ubuntu -u root`)

```sh
install -o appsvc -g appsvc -m 755 /home/dev/dist/temur /srv/rustcode-runtime/bin/app
mkdir -p /srv/rustcode-runtime/work && chown appsvc:appsvc /srv/rustcode-runtime/work
```

## 2. Inject the real credential (root; once; see SETUP.md)

```sh
install -o appsvc -g appsvc -m 600 /path/to/real-credential /srv/rustcode-secrets/credential
```

The app reads it by path via `APP_SECRET_FILE` (set by `run-app.sh`). It never appears
in argv, env values, logs, or the process's own output. The app does not read
`ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` at all.

Optional config (model, max_tokens, thinking) — appsvc's HOME is
`/srv/rustcode-runtime`, so the file is
`/srv/rustcode-runtime/.config/temur/config.json`, e.g.
`{"model": "claude-sonnet-5"}`. Defaults: claude-sonnet-5, 32000 max_tokens,
thinking off.

Provider selection (T2): `{"provider": "openai-compat", "openai_compat":
{"base_url": "http://127.0.0.1:8080/v1", "model": "<model-id>"}}` targets any
OpenAI-compatible endpoint (llama.cpp, Ollama, vLLM, LM Studio, or a hosted
compat API). Local endpoints need no credential — omit `api_key_file` and no
auth header is sent. A keyed endpoint reads its key from `api_key_file`, a
file path with the same isolation rule as `APP_SECRET_FILE` (never env, never
argv). The default provider remains `anthropic`; selecting the compat
provider leaves the Anthropic fields untouched.

## 3. One-time SSE capture (golden fixtures), then the smoke

Run the first turn with capture enabled so the raw wire streams get frozen into the
test suite (SSE bodies contain no credentials — the key travels only in a request
header, which is never written):

```sh
cd /srv/rustcode-runtime/work
runuser -u appsvc -- env APP_SECRET_FILE=/srv/rustcode-secrets/credential \
    /srv/rustcode-runtime/bin/app --capture-sse /tmp/oc-capture
```

**UI selection (since milestone B):** on a real terminal the app opens the
ratatui TUI by default; piped/scripted runs (and anything non-TTY) get the v1
line REPL automatically. For a transcript-friendly scripted smoke, force the
line REPL with `--plain`; `--tui` forces the TUI; `tui-probe` verifies the
terminal (alt screen + keys) without touching the API. Note one plain-REPL
change since v1: provider-level errors now print as `[!] provider error: …`
on **stdout** (previously stderr) — adjust any stderr-filtering scripts.

At the `>` prompt (line REPL) or in the TUI input line, run the Tier-1 smoke
script (one prompt per line):

1. `Create a file named smoke.txt containing the single line "tier1", then read it back to me.`
   — expect: `write` then `read` tool activity; the reply quotes `tier1`.
2. `Run the shell command "uname -m" and tell me the output.`
   — expect: `bash` tool activity; the reply contains `i686` (via linux32 personality)
   or `x86_64` (host kernel) — either proves live execution; note which.
3. `Change smoke.txt so it says "tier1 passed" instead, and confirm by reading it.`
   — expect: `edit` tool activity; the reply confirms the new content.
4. `exit`

**Pass criteria (Tier 1):** coherent streamed responses; at least one full tool
round-trip per prompt; `smoke.txt` on disk ends up containing `tier1 passed`; usage
lines show nonzero input/output tokens; no `[!]` provider errors.

## 4. Return artifacts to the builder (root)

```sh
mkdir -p /home/dev/dist/return
cp /tmp/oc-capture.*.sse /home/dev/dist/return/
script -c ... # (if you ran under `script`, also copy the transcript)
chown -R dev:dev /home/dev/dist/return
rm -f /tmp/oc-capture.*.sse
```

The builder freezes the captures into `tests/fixtures/live/` and runs the parser
conformance test over them; any drift from the hand-authored fixtures becomes an
offline test failure from then on.

## Notes / troubleshooting

- `secret: APP_SECRET_FILE is not set` — run via `run-app.sh` or pass the env as above.
- `secret: cannot read credential file` — check ownership/mode (`appsvc:appsvc` 600)
  and that you're running as `appsvc`.
- `api error (HTTP 401)` — the credential file's contents are wrong (whole file is
  used, trimmed, as the API key).
- The build environment never performs this procedure; per project rules the live API
  is only ever touched here, by the operator, as `appsvc`.
